# Information Sharing and Safeguarding Playbook

This Playbook is intended to help users in their quest to create or enhance an effective and efficient Information Sharing and Safeguarding (IS&S) Environment, and can be used at any point in the environmentâ€™s lifecycle.

One way to advance the IS&S Environment is by putting the right processes and practices in place to drive outcomes and accountability and allow people and companies to do their best work. The IS&S Playbook documents these best practices and processes.

This is a draft version and user feedback is always welcome. We are especially interested in hearing from the community about additional resources for the plays.
