title: Document everything
---

Imagine you built a web service API and then forgot about it for a year.  Would your documentation be descriptive enough to immediately start using your own service?  Be kind to your future self -- document everything.


### Checklist
1. Include an example call and response in the documentation.  Something that a developer can copy and paste into the browser to validate the response.
2. Consider existing projects that automatically generate documentation sites, like [Swagger](http://swagger.io/), [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate), [ApiDocJS](http://apidocjs.com/), [SpringRestDoc](https://bitbucket.org/tritales/springrestdoc/overview), or [RAML](http://raml.org/).
3. Identify optional versus required arguments.
4. Structure the input and output response types in a table.  Each row is an input argument or response field, with at least one attribute column to document the appropriate data type -- e.g., string, integer, float.


### Key Questions
- If a developer wants to contribute, can the find where and how within the documentation?
- Are the limitations of the returned data clear to developers to ensure proper and meaningful use?
- Are there referrals to projects that rely on the web services?  If so, it may be worth including them in the documentation -- at least the documentation header.
- Does your documentation or developer page require a custom solution, or can you rely on existing documentation projects?
