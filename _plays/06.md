title: Identify relevant standards
---

Early in the process, jump start the project by identifying applicable Information Sharing and Safeguarding (IS&S) standards. Leverage the great strides made over the last decade by adopting these polished IS&S products that have been shaped by user experience. IS&S standards were created to provide a common approach to sharing electronic information among tribal, territorial, local, state, and Federal organizations. Standards help define business processes, provide a common framework, platform, and language to exchange information, and assist with security and privacy. The governance body must be actively engaged in the identification and the application of these standards especially in the context of the policy including privacy concerns.

### Checklist
1. Cast a wide net when considering information sharing and safeguarding standards, including national and international standards that contribute to project success.
2. Standards are the lifeblood of information sharing and safeguarding efforts and must be used where applicable. If standards are not an immediate option, consider how they may impact the IS&S Environment over the complete lifecycle.
3. Whenever possible, seek training opportunities to become more familiar with existing standards and their application.
4. Define a specific list of standards that will become the basis of the project (e.g., NIEM, security, privacy, and geospatial standards).
5. Acquire training for developers in the application of standards in building out an IS&S Environment.
6. Ensure that the governance body and participating agencies are committed to the use of standards.

### Key Questions
- What standards will be most helpful in expediting information exchanges in less time for development and implementation?
- What standards will be applied to ensure privacy and security in the IS&S Environment?
- What expertise is required of the development team to ensure that the standards are appropriately included in the solution designs?
