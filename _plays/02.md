title: Consider the Developer Experience (DX)
---

The web service APIs are basic infrastructure.  They are the roads that developers will drive on.  Ensure that the roads are well-designed.  It should be a natural joy to use the APIs.  Consider the experience of the users, and the use will follow.

### Checklist
1. Reference design standards for building a good API, like the [White House API standards](https://github.com/WhiteHouse/api-standards) or [Code Planet's P of API design](https://codeplanet.io/principles-good-restful-api-design).
2. Ensure consistency across resources.  For example, don't use country codes in one query and country names in another.
3. Sit with a user and take notes on how easy it is to use the API -- and then iterate.  


### Key Questions
- When talking to users of the API, do they think it feels well-designed?  Does it have good bones?  Does it inspire trust?
- Do users get stuck in the same place over and over again?
- What would [Bostock](https://github.com/mbostock) do?  WWBD?
