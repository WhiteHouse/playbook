title: Be an upstanding citizen of the web

The highest form of courtesy on the web, just as in driving, is efficiency and dependability.  Surprises and ambiguities lead to crashes.  Natural, simple, and dependable APIs can create a vibrant ecosystem of applications that can change the world. Believe that. 

### Checklist
1. All URL enpoints should be durable, even when changes are made to the web service.  This may require versioning your APIs.
2. Write the URL endpoints so that they are human readable.  
3. Avoid using randomly generated strings or hashes in the URL, if your API is purely `GET` requests.  These aren't readable.
4. Use HTTP status codes.  [TODO: add REFERENCE]
5. Ensure that the APIs (or at least the documentation) are discoverable on the web.
6. Employ SEO so that people can find them. [TODO: add more]

### Key Questions
- What happens when you add a new resource?  Will it alter existing endpoints?  And will those alterations break a dependent app?
- Can you explain the structure of the URL in less than a minute?  Will a user be able to adjust an example query without guidance?
