title: Build trust
---

You are providing a service to external users via the web -- a web service.  Ensuring that there are developers on the other end willing to use that service requires a reasonably high level of trust.  If they build something today, can they use it tomorrow?  Building and maintaining trust through openness, communication, licensing, and setting appropriate expectations is important for sustained use.


### Checklist
1. Default to open licensing.  Default to open everything.
2. Clarify what sort of applications the web service will support, e.g., list rate limits or constraints on origin headers.
3. Build in a monitor for API downtime. Consider, for example, something as simple as [status images](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/status-images) to display the health of the service.
4. Be very explicit about the uncertainty surrounding the data, and the implied limitations on applications. 

### Key Questions
- Are the limitations on both the service and supporting data immediately apparent?
- Who is the intended audience of the service?  Who should be careful when relying on the service, since it's not meant for certain applications?  It cannot be everything to everyone.
- Is it easy to find where users can go to interact with a human?  Is there a Google Group or a Github repository linked to the service for users to raise issues?
