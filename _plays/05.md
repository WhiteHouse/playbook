title: Define capabilities
---

Defining Information Sharing and Safeguarding (IS&S) Environment capabilities shouldn’t be stressful, confusing, or daunting. The capabilities identified should be simple and intuitive with the goal of enabling users to support the mission of their agencies and overcome obstacles. The technical capabilities identified if already developed and implemented by other stakeholder or community should be evaluated and reused where applicable. Where possible, leverage existing investments with proven track records of success and documented lessons learned in developing the IS&S Environment’s capabilities.

### Checklist
1. Identify role-based user requirements for the IS&S Environment that are more specific to the user experience than the business requirements identified in an earlier play.
2. Identify the technology stack necessary based on collected business, user, and technology requirements, with a focus on maximizing reuse of an existing technology stack.
3. Identify the advantages and challenges of different environments (internal, cloud-based, hybrid) and make the decision about hosting considering the identified items in light of the user needs and other relevant parameters such as cost.
4. Create or use an existing, simple, and flexible design style guide.
5. Give users clear information about where they are in each step of the process.
6. Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the IS&S Environment.
7. Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process where applicable.
8. Use language that is familiar to the user and easy to understand.
9. Use language and design consistently throughout the IS&S Environment, including online and offline touch points.

### Key Questions
- What primary tasks are the users trying to accomplish?
- What are the user requirements that support role-based information sharing and safeguarding?
- What are the capabilities that will developed or reused?
- What technologies are required to meet the user needs?
- What are the pros and cons of the technology stack? How does this impact the buy versus build decisions for hosting (i.e., software as a service, cloud storage)?
- Are there legacy systems that can be reconstituted to better share and safeguard information and meet identified user needs?
- What specific safeguarding measures will be employed?
- If a user needs help while using the IS&S Environment, how do they go about getting it?
- How does the IS&S Environment’s design visually relate to other government services?
- How can you measure the capabilities? Can you verify through automated tests?
