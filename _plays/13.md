title: Share your experiences
---

Every Information Sharing and Safeguarding (IS&S) Environment project offers value for all the projects that come after it. As members of the greater community of interest, sharing our IS&S Environment successes and failures is critical to the success of the information sharing and safeguarding mission. Not only will contributing your project information help others build IS&S Environment capabilities, but as you become more familiar with the community and the resources it includes, it will improve your chances of success in your next IS&S Environment endeavor!

### Checklist
1. Document successes and failures as both are equally valuable to your future projects and the IS&S Environment projects of the greater community of interest.
2. Identify the relevant community of interest organizations related to your IS&S Environment project (i.e., standards development organizations, industry organizations, government repositories, Standards Coordinating Council) and share your experiences, best practices and documentation as allowable.
3. Contribute specific information about standard use to the organizations with ownership of the standards used in your IS&S Environment.
4. Consider compliance certification (e.g., Springboard Certification Program, Open Geospatial Consortium Compliance Testing and Certification), which will document the success of your IS&S Environment and contribute to the larger body of knowledge in the process.
5. Contribute Information Exchange Package Documentations (IEPDs) to the IEPD Clearinghouse.
6. When appropriate, publish source code of projects or components online.
7. When appropriate, share your development process and progress publicly.
8. Consider presenting your findings at conferences and educational summits within appropriate communities of interest.

### Key Questions
- What do I have that will be useful to others?
- How can the team get involved in organizations within the community of interest?
- Where do I go to share my lessons learned and best practices?
- How do we share our success stories with the legislators and sponsors?
- What are the failures and how are we going to address them to ensure corrective actions in the current IS&S Environment and prevent future failures?
