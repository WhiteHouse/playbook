title:  Identify and get support from critical sponsors
---

Obtaining support, resources, and funding to enable different capabilities in the IS&S Environment is one of the most significant obstacles to overcome, especially in tight fiscal times. It is important to identify the critical sponsors who support the IS&S Environment’s mission-critical endeavor and are willing to help fund the project to showcase the value. It is helpful to engage these key sponsors in a collaborative process to develop a funding strategy built on a strong and well-defined business case that demonstrates the mission problem an IS&S Environment will solve.

### Checklist
1. Getting sponsors starts with identifying user groups or organizations that care about the problem of information sharing and believe the IS&S Environment is an important step in solving problems.
2. Gather small groups of people who are stakeholders or who care about improving information sharing in order to prevent harm or promote resiliency.
3. Seek start-up investments to get the concept moving.
4. Funding for a complete IS&S Environment is rare, and teams should always consider scalability and sustainability. Develop a funding plan that doesn’t rely on one-time, up-front, complete funding.
5. Have a phased funding plan to share with potential sponsors.

### Key Questions
- Have you accurately identified potential stakeholders and defined the role of each stakeholder organization?
- Are there individuals in stakeholder organizations who are passionate about the need for information sharing and might wish to help find sponsors?
- What will it cost to get the project off the ground and start something that people can rally around to finish?
- Have you developed an approach for critical sponsor support that clearly defines the return on investment?
- How will you document critical sponsor support commitments (e.g., memoranda of understanding)?
- Who are the stakeholders that might step up to become sponsors?
