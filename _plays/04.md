title: Build the service using agile and iterative practices
---

We use an incremental, fast-paced style of software development to reduce the risk of failure. We want to get working software into users’ hands as early as possible to give the design and development team opportunities to adjust and respond to user needs. A critical capability is being able to automatically test and deploy the service so that new features can be added often and be put into production easily.

#### checklist
1. Ship a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that solves a core user need as soon as possible, no longer than three months from the beginning of the project, with an optional “beta” or “test” period
2. Run usability tests frequently to see how well the service works and identify improvements that should be made
3. Ensure the individuals building the service communicate closely in daily standups, chat tools, and launch meetings
4. Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners
5. Release features and improvements multiple times each month
6. Create a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as “feature backlog” and “bug backlog”
7. Use an issue tracker, or ticketing system, to catalog features and bugs
8. Use a source code version control system
9. Give the entire project team access to the issue tracker and version control system
10. Use code reviews to ensure quality


#### key questions
- How long did it take to ship the MVP? If it hasn’t shipped yet, when will it?
- How long does it take for a production deployment?
- How many days or weeks are in each sprint?
- Which version control system is being used?
- How are we tracking bugs and issue feature requests?
- How are we managing the backlog?
- How often do you review and reprioritize the backlog?
- How do you collect user feedback during development? How is that feedback incorporated into plans to improve the service?
- At each stage of usability testing, which gaps were identified in addressing user needs?
