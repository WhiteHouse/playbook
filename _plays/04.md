title: Be a part of the community and ask for help
---

There are developers eager to help.  Working on the SDGs feels important, much more important than selling ads or optimizing sales.  If you don't understand something, ask the community.  Even asking the question in an open, persistent forum is a contribution to the open source community.  And if you are an advanced developer, contribute to the open source community! 

### Checklist
1. Visit the issues page *of this site* for this project with any questions about how to start.  Example issues are available [here]().  
2. Visit [Stack Overflow] or join a global development [Google Group] to ask for help.  
3.  The Global Partnership [Marketplace]() will be a forum to raise needs for technical support or application development.  You are among friends and family here.


### Key Questions
- Do you know where to go to ask for help?  If not, visit the issues page for this repository.  Sign up for a free [Github account](), and pose a question to the group.
- Have you written anything for your app that might be useful to another app?  If so, and when appropriate, can you contribute the code on an open source project?
