title: Go live!
---

After the development and testing are done, it is time to go live. The Information Sharing and Safeguarding (IS&S) Environment should be deployed on flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real time to meet identified user requirements and user demand. Going live is more than simply flipping the on switch – it involves user acceptance testing as a proof point for identified user requirements, organizing all the stakeholders for the transition, and training users on the new IS&S Environment.

### Checklist
1. User acceptance testing on live systems should be correlated with previously-identified requirements and documented.
2. Identify training requirements for different categories of users and develop a plan for providing training during the go live period and into the future as staff changes occur.
3. Ensure the availability of user help resources.
4. It helps to have an assigned person from a solution provider so you don’t have to educate a new person each time on what is happening and what should or should not be occurring.
5. Consider the continuity of operations plan and the relationship to the new IS&S Environment.
6. Develop the processes for the collection, documentation, and dissemination of performance measures.
7. Evaluate the need for subsequent releases and prepare the follow-up release plan and structure.

### Key Questions
- What data redundancy do you have built into the system, and what would be the impact of a catastrophic data loss?
- How often do you need to contact a person from your provider to get resources or to fix an issue?
- Is there a triage plan if patches or fixes are needed to ensure the more critical fixes are addressed immediately and less critical fixes are appropriately schedule?
- What are the different types of IS&S Environment users? What training will they need to use the IS&S Environment to achieve stated goals?
- Does your IS&S Environment involve data that is open to the public? How will you communicate this availability to the public and educate them on the use of the interface?
- Do the various groups of users know how to get help when using the IS&S Environment?
- Have you developed the test scripts for user acceptance testing?
- Have you identified the test group?
- How are you collecting user feedback for bugs and issues?
