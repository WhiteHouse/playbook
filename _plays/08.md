title: Make it easy to use
---

### Checklist
1.  Provide reference implementation.  
2.  Write modifiable examples.
3.  Even create client-side wrappers with use, if you have the resources.  This brings the service even closer to the end-use.
4.  Try it out yourself!

### Key Questions
- How long does it take to build a toy application on the service?
- Can the service be used in a hackathon?  Even if you are not there to guide or instruct participants?
- Is there a way to easily incorporate the underlying data into a rectangular data format for statistical analysis or reporting?
